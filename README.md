my name is Elinor
I'm a senior in high school

I'm super hungry right now but I don't have lunch for another two hours.
some Taco bell sounds really good right now.

it's raining very hard outside.
I wish this classroom had big windows like the ones at the end of the hall.
I love watching rain fall
